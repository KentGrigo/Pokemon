# Pokemon

## What is this?
This is my implementation of Pokemon Red/Blue.

## How to run?
Open `index.html` or go here: https://kentgrigo.github.io/Pokemon/

## Status
Currently, the game supports walking around in Pallet Town and Route 1.
You can fight encounters when walking in the grass.
The encounters are limited to Ratatas and Pidgeys.
Your pokemon is fixed to be Squirtle.

Except of obvious part of adding more content beyond Route 1, the game doesn't support the following features

### Battle mode
- EXP and leveling
- using items
- change Pokemon

### Roaming mode
- entering houses
  - talking to people
  - choosing starter Pokemon
  - interacting with the computer
- reading signs
- menu
  - saving
  - browsing Pokemon
  - browsing Pokedex

### Graphics
- aspect ratio
- background color
